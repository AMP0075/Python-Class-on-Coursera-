Python-Class-on-Coursera-
=========================

I have attended Interactive Programming on Python offered by Rice University through Coursera, Keeping here some of my mini projects which were a part of the course.


Keeping these game codes as help and guidelines only, We should follow the principles of honor code and try to write our own codes (It's really not that difficult, so please try your own)
